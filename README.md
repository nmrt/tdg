Tested in Firefox and Chromium (recent versions).

In order for it to work locally, you'll need either to configure the browser to accept
local *cross-origin* requests (`file:` protocol) or run a `httpd`. More info:
[How to run things
locally](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally).

There are different configurations in `levels/`. Specify a level with query
parameter like `?level=cross-fire` or default one will be used.
