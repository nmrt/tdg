Tower Defence *Game*
====================

Exploration of LimeJS, Closure and Canvas.

Tested in Firefox and Chromium (recent versions).

In order for it to work, you'll need either to configure the browser to accept
local *cross-origin* requests (`file:` protocol) or run a `httpd`. More info:
[How to run things
locally](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally).

There are different configurations in `levels/`. Just replace the contents of
`preferences.json` with one of them and reload `tdg.html`. ;)
